# ===================================================
In the associated video and article on JetsonHacks a 
Chinese version of an Arduiono Nano was used. Instead
of a FTDI chip, a CH340 serial to USB chip is used.

On the Jetson TK1, a kernel module is needed to interface
with the CH340. In the kernel config file, the entry is listed
as:

USB Winchiphead CH341 Single Port Serial Driver

After compile the kernel, it may be necessary to copy zImage to /boot

One issue that presented itself is that if the rosserial node was used
more than once, the Nano would hang. This appears to be related on this
particular chip to the pyserial library. On the Jetson, pyserial is 2.6 which exhibits the issue. Rolling back to version 2.5 seems to fix the problem for this particular board.

To install pyserial 2.5:

sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
pip install --user 'pyserial==2.5'
